So make sure you have a nice recovery, more protein, clean carbohydrates, healthy fats and good sleep, they are gonna speed up the recovery process. Make sure you have them on your to-do list for today. If you are a pro and would like to work out anyways, press a list of exercises and choose the muscle group which you would like to hit. Cheers Champ!',
